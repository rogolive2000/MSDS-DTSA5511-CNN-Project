# MSDS-DTSA5511-CNN-Project

Project Description and Objective
The ojective of this project is to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm to accurately identify metastatic cancer in small image patches extracted from larger digital pathology scans. Metastatic cancer is a condition where cancer cells spread from the primary site of origin to other parts of the body. The detection of metastatic cancer is critical for proper diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients.

The algorithm will be trained on a large dataset of digitized histopathology images, consisting of both cancerous and non-cancerous tissue samples. The dataset will be pre-processed to extract small image patches of the tissue samples, which will be used as inputs for the CNN.

The CNN will consist of several layers, including convolutional layers for feature extraction and pooling layers for down-sampling. The architecture will also include fully connected layers for classification. The model will be trained using a supervised learning approach, where the CNN will learn to differentiate between cancerous and non-cancerous tissue samples.

The performance of the algorithm will be evaluated using several metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The algorithm will also be tested on a separate dataset to assess its generalization ability. Additionally, the algorithm will be compared to existing methods for the detection of metastatic cancer in histopathology images.
